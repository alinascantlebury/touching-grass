    <h1>My life online vs irl is very closesly interconnected. I live the farthest away from my family and my high
        school friends so I use social media to stay close to them as opposed to calling on the phone, not in a bad way
        and if anything we talk more becuase its not a call. I take a lot of inspiration from online and apply it to
        real life. I love scrolling on are.na and pinterest for niche images and connecting them. I have an extensive
        pinterest page dedicated to preparing for a multitude of imaginary projects I want to work on. I call my time
        online research because online spaces do mean a lot to me as it is a way to be creative without being physical,
        I muhc rather being creative digitally than working with my hands with something physical. However, I like to
        portray myself the same irl and online there is no persona I want to embody but a true sense of self. </h1>
